				My small CLI program Dog was rewirten again this time in Go.
				First version was written in Rust, but i got stuck when adding new features because
				i find this language super hard. So I rewritten Dog in Ruby while adding new features.
				Now i rewritten it for 3rd time. I was learning Go so I thought I can write Dog in Go
				for practice reasons. And I did. I removed the Ruby version and now you can download the Go one.
				I did that because Go version is faster and does not require any additional dependencies.
				I also made installing way easier by providing commands for that.
