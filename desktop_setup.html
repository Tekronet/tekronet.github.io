			<p>I use OpenSuse Tumbleweed as my daily driver because it is my favourite GNU/Linux distro out there.
			It is a rolling release distribution so i get the newest software updates, but it is also one of the most stable rolling distros.
			Another reason for using it is YaST. It lets you control almost everything on your system.
			With it you can also easy create snapshots thanks to btrfs filesystem that OpenSuse uses.
			And last reason for using this OS is its speed. Really, it is super fast. Everything feels snappy and instant.
			I compared it to other distros like Pop_OS! and every time OpenSuse is the fastest.	</p>

			<p>Taking about desktop enviroment I use Gnome. It is one of the most hated Linux desktops but I actually really like it.
			It is not that customizable as KDE but I don't need all of that stuff that Plasma offers. I am just changing some fonts and GTK theme.
			Many people criticize Gnome for being very resource heavy. It is not a lightweight desktop but it is not also that bad as some people say.
			With OpenSuse on startup it uses 800mb of ram and a little bit of CPU. The best thing about Gnome and the reason why I like it and use it
			is that it is very polished. It looks pretty nice and is very stable. I never encountered any issues or bugs when using it.
			I tried using KDE but every time I try to use it I run into some really annoying issues. I also tried window managers such as i3, spectrwm and Openbox.
			Those are pretty cool to use but require a lot of time and work to get a nice experience. 
			</p>

			<p>My terminal emulator of choice is Gnome terminal with Bash shell. I tried using Alacritty but it was little bit to much for me
			and I encountered some issues. Bash is my shell of choice. I also tried using Fish but there were some problems with running Ruby scripts
			on it and Fish has some syntax diffrences compared with Bash that I am not used to.</p>
